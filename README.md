## Info

I have written the **Smooth Anchor Scrolling** to improve the weight of your callbacks. I was using Twitter's [Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com/) when i wrote this and i'm surprised they haven't yet built anything in. Alas! I have written a *super lightweight smooth scroll plugin* free for you all to use. I have deliberately not included a plugin such as Scrollspy as i built this for use with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) that already has Scrollspy within.

## Compatibility

Currently works well on all modern browsers such as:
* Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Firefox
* IE10

I have also tested this on current mobile operating systems:
* iOS6
* iOS7
* Jellybean
* BB OS10 Software


Despite not being tested in previous versions of Internet Explorer i have full-faith that it will work back to IE7 and it's predecessor as it's leveraging jQuery functions such as `.animate`, `.closest` and others.
